Projects
========

* 1997-1999 [Python2C](https://web.archive.org/web/20011025084441/http://www.mudlib.org/~rassilon/p2c/)
* 1997-2000 PyFront (afterwards Basil)
* 1998-11 7th International Python Conference
  * From Jon Riehl's [notes](https://wildideas.org/basil/):
  > Last year (IPC7,) I thought I was going to surprise the Python community
  > by presenting a prototype Python to C translator. Little did I know,
  > I was only one of three people who announced such a product.
 * These apparently were:
   * "Converting Python Virtual Machine Code to C", John Aycock
   * "PyFront: Conversion of Python to C Extension Modules", Jon Riehl
   * (3rd - ???)
* 2000-01 8th International Python Conference
  * From Jon Riehl's [notes](https://wildideas.org/basil/):
  > This year (IPC8,) in the interest of keeping people up to date,
  > there was a two hour session that hosted the developers of these
  > prototypes. The only system left standing is now complete and under
  > beta test. Bill Tutt and Greg Stein cowrote Python2C, which they
  > have been continuing to work on at (http://www.mudlib.org/~rassilon/p2c/).
  > The other player is John Aycock. John declared he would look into run time
  > type instrumentation, which I think should end up forming some sort of a
  > JIT for Python. He lives at: (http://gulf.uvic.ca/~aycock/)

Static Analysis
===============

* https://github.com/sdiehl/subpy - Subpy is a library for defining subsets
of the Python language and querying ASTs for language-level properties that
are specified as sets of features.


Parsers
=======

* https://github.com/python/typed_ast - Modified fork of CPython's ast module
  that parses `# type:` comments.
* https://github.com/m-labs/pythonparser - "Parses source code into an AST
  that is a superset of Pythonâ€™s built-in ast module".
* https://github.com/lark-parser/lark/blob/master/examples/python3.lark - Python3
  grammar for Lark parser.
